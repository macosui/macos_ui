A starter Flutter app for macOS with `macos_ui`.

## Getting Started

to achieve UI and UX that match their native AppKit counterparts as closely as possible.

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)
