## [2.0.0-beta.1]
üö® Breaking Changes üö®
* Migrate macos_ui to [macos_window_utils](https://pub.dev/packages/macos_window_utils), which provides the following benefits:
  * Window animation smoothness is drastically improved, particularly when miniaturizing and deminiaturizing the application window.
  * Some visual artifacts that occurred while the window was being (de)miniaturized (such as the application's shadow going missing) no longer occur.
  * The sidebar remains transparent when the app's brightness setting mismatches the OS setting.
  * Wallpaper tinting is now supported.

To migrate an existing application, please refer to the ‚ÄúModern window look‚Äù section in the README.

## [1.12.5]
* Fixed a bug where the `Sidebar.key` parameter wasn't used, which caused certain layouts to be unachievable.

## [1.12.4]
* Default the `_selectedDay` state variable to be 1 when selecting the previous/next month from widget to ensure new date is valid for `_formatAsDateTime()` method (https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/123669 & https://github.com/macosui/macos_ui/pull/402)

## [1.12.3]
* Added support for `routerConfig` to `MacosApp.router`. ([#388](https://github.com/macosui/macos_ui/issues/388))

## [1.12.2]
* Fixed a bug where clicking on a overflowed toolbar item with a navigation callback wouldn't work ([#346](https://github.com/GroovinChip/macos_ui/issues/346)).

## [1.12.1+1]
* Fixed a typo in the December abbreviation displayed in the `MacosDatePicker`.

## [1.12.1]
* Fix SidebarItem's leading icons not respecting the theme's primary color

## [1.12.0]
‚ú® New widget: `SliverToolBar`

## [1.11.1]
* Fixed an issue where the `MacosSearchField` would not perform an action when an item was selected.

## [1.11.0]
* üö® Breaking Changes üö®
* `ResizablePane` can now be vertically resized
  * `ResizablePane.startWidth` has been changed to `ResizablePane.startSize`
  * `ResizablePane.minWidth` has been changed to `ResizablePane.minSize`
  * `ResizablePane.maxWidth` has been changed to `ResizablePane.maxSize`

## [1.10.0]
üö® Breaking Changes üö®
* `MacosScrollbar` has been completely overhauled and now resembles the native macOS scrollbar in appearance and
  behavior. Previously, it wrapped the material scrollbar, and now creates a custom scrollbar that extends
  `RawScrollbar`. This resulted in the removal of several material-based properties for the scrollbar, and
  `ContentArea.builder` is once again a `ScrollableWidgetBuilder`! üéâ
* Removed material-based scrollbar properties from `MacosScrollbarThemeData`

Other changes:
* Added implementation of `MacosDisclosureButton`
* Fixed a bug where `CapacityIndicator` only worked correctly for splits = 10

## [1.9.1]
* Adds optional `initialDate` to `MacosDatePicker`

## [1.9.0]
* Implement `MacosSlider`

## [1.8.0]
üö® Breaking Changes üö®
* `ContentArea.builder` has been changed from a `ScrollableWidgetBuilder` to a `WidgetBuilder` due to
changes in Flutter 3.7. The `MacosScrollbar` widget needs to undergo radical changes in order to achieve the
native macOS scrollbar look and feel in the future, so this will be revisited at that time.

Other changes:
* Per Flutter 3.7.0: Replace deprecated `MacosTextField.toolbarOptions` with `MacosTextField.contextMenuBuilder`
* Ensure the color panel releases when it is closed
* Avoid render overflows in the `Sidebar` when the window height is resized below a certain threshold ([#325](https://github.com/GroovinChip/macos_ui/issues/325))
* Update `MacosScrollbar.thumbVisibility` with the latest change introduced in Flutter 3.7

## [1.7.1]
* Fixed an issue where end sidebar window breakpoints were not respected

## [1.7.0]
* ‚ú® New
  * `MacosImageIcon` widget. Identical to the `ImageIcon` from `flutter/widgets.dart` except it will obey a
`MacosIconThemeData` instead of an `IconThemeData`
  * `SidebarItemSize` enum, which determines the height of sidebar items and the maximum size their `leading` widgets.
  * `SidebarItem` now accepts an optional `trailing` widget.
* üîÑ Updated
  * `SidebarItems` now supports `SidebarItemSize` via the `itemSize` property, which defaults to
`SidebarItemSize.medium`. The widget has been updated to manage the item's height, the maximum size of the item's
leading widget, and the font size of the item's label widget according to the given `SidebarItemSize`.
  * The example app has been tweaked to use some icons from the SF Symbols 4 Beta via the new `MacosImageIcon` widget.

## [1.6.0]
* New widgets: `MacosTabView` and `MacosTabView`
* BREAKING CHANGE: `Label.yAxis` has been renamed to `Label.crossAxisAlignment`
